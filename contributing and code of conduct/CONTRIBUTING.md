## 1 · Welcome

Thank you for helping advance open, reproducible paediatric-malaria research!  
Whether you are improving code, fixing typos, or adding new analyses, your
contributions are valued.

## 2 · Key Principles

* **Reproducibility first** – every commit should leave the repository in a state
  that rebuilds end-to-end via the GitHub Actions workflow.  
* **Privacy & ethics** – raw identifiable data **must never** be pushed to GitHub.
  Only de-identified, aggregated, or simulated data belong here.  
* **Friendly collaboration** – see the Code of Conduct for behaviour standards.
