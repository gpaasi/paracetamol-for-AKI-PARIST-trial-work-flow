# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct
_Version 2.1 • <https://www.contributor-covenant.org>_

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in the
**PARIST Trial Workflow** project a harassment‑free experience for everyone,
regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex
characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
education, socio‑economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race,
religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behaviour that contributes to a positive environment include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people  
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences  
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback  
* Taking responsibility and apologising to those affected by our mistakes, and
  learning from the experience  
* Focusing on what is best for the community and the project  

Examples of unacceptable behaviour include:

* The use of sexualised language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances  
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks  
* Public or private harassment  
* Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission  
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting  

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards
of acceptable behaviour and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behaviour that they deem inappropriate, threatening,
offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces—GitHub repo,
issue trackers, pull‑requests, and private channels—and also applies when an
individual is officially representing the project in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be
reported by contacting the maintainer team at
`parist‑trial‑maintainers@protonmail.com`. All complaints will be reviewed
and investigated promptly and fairly.

All maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.
